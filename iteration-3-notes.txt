write a function that takes an electorate name and winner as input

- iterates through the this.allElectorates array
	- appends the winning party to the electorate instance
	

what i did

create a new instance of the electorate class with the necessary electorate winner attribute

things to understand:
-how code methods to set new attributes for the classes
e.g. 
a) setVotePercent(partyName,votePercent) => allParties(name,votePercent)
b) setWinningParty(electorateName,electorateWinner) => allElectorates(name,winner)
	theory:
	-either create new instances or mutate the originals.
