created 
	specrunner test units
		ElectorateSpecs.js
		ElectorateTableArraySpec.js
			created check for the name of last electorate and party
			created check for count of electorates and parties in array.
		PartySpec.js
		PartyTableArraySpec.js
			created check for the name of last of party
			created check for count of parties in array
		
			these overall took 5 hours > typing and formatting
	
	
	election methods because of specrunner check,also used it in the table head
	 	countParties
		countElectorates
			this took <5 minutes

removed
	newline before and after heading of title
		in View.js removed NEWLINE from print function
			before > document.body.innerHTML += NEWLINE + newText
			after > document.body.innerHTML += newText
				this took 20 minutes to find

changed
	table text color to be blue inside table_style.css
		added inside table{} > color: blue;

		added a th style > border: 0px; > text-algin: center;

# need to add into specrunner: 
	check number of parties in election

+ solutions to problems were completely obvious in hindsight
	a particular issue is writing code, then forgetting to rename one the variable
		spotting that issue during debugging took longer than it should have


+ create sequence diagram
	
+ update the class diagram

+ write up report
	task estimations and actuals
	evidence of unit testing and style check
